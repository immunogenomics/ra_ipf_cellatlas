# ra_ipf_cellatlas

This git repo is the source code to visualize our analysis and reesults of comparison across multiple lung phenotypes using single-cell technologies.

We focus on rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD), and its similarities and differences with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and other lung-related phenotypes.
